       "   'content': \"# Central Valley and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta\\n\\nThe community revolves around the Central Valley, a significant agricultural and energy-producing region in California, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a critical water supply hub. The Central Valley is bounded by various mountain ranges and is divided into the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley by the Delta. The region is also home to specific flora such as the Fremont cottonwood and Valley oak.\\n\\n## Central Valley as a key agricultural and energy region\\n\\nThe Central Valley is a large and fertile agricultural region located in the center of California, known for its significant agricultural output and deposits of crude oil and natural gas. This region is crucial for California's economy, providing a substantial portion of the state's agricultural products and energy resources. The Central Valley's productivity is supported by its rich soil and the water supplied by the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers [Data: Entities (15); Relationships (14, 410, 411)].\\n\\n## Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta's critical role in water supply\\n\\nThe Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for California, providing drinking water for nearly 23 million people and supporting agricultural needs. The Delta divides the Central Valley into the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley, playing a vital role in the region's water management and agricultural success. The Delta's importance is underscored by its role in sustaining both human populations and agricultural activities [Data: Entities (140); Relationships (71, 404, 436, 438)].\\n\\n## Geographical boundaries of the Central Valley\\n\\nThe Central Valley is geographically bounded by several mountain ranges: the Coastal Mountain Ranges to the west, the Sierra Nevada to the east, the Cascade Range to the north, and the Tehachapi Mountains to the south. These natural boundaries contribute to the region's unique climate and environmental conditions, which are conducive to its agricultural productivity. Understanding these geographical boundaries is essential for comprehending the region's environmental and economic dynamics [Data: Entities (146, 148); Relationships (405, 406, 407, 402)].\\n\\n## Flora thriving in the Central Valley\\n\\nThe Central Valley is home to specific flora such as the Fremont cottonwood and Valley oak, which thrive in the region's unique environmental conditions.

Key entities include the United States Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, and various religious organizations. The relationships among these entities highlight Alaska's demographic diversity, economic dependencies, and cultural significance.\\n\\n## Alaska's Unique Geographical Position\\n\\nAlaska is a non-contiguous U.S. state located on the northwest extremity of North America. It is the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than Texas, California, and Montana combined. Alaska shares a maritime border with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Bering Strait and borders the Canadian territory of Yukon and the province of British Columbia to the east. This unique geographical position makes Alaska a significant entity in terms of both national security and natural resource management [Data: Claims (240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 246)].\\n\\n## Diverse Demographic Composition\\n\\nAlaska has a diverse population with a variety of languages and religions. According to the 2020 United States Census, Alaska's population was 733,391. The state has a significant Indigenous population, which is proportionally the second highest of any U.S. state at over 15 percent. The American Community Survey and other demographic studies have provided detailed insights into the racial and ethnic composition of Alaska's population, highlighting its diversity [Data: Claims (247, 254, 290, 291, 293, 295, 296, 297, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305)].\\n\\n## Economic Dependencies and Challenges\\n\\nAlaska's economy is significantly driven by the oil and gas industry, with commercial fishing and tourism also contributing substantially. The state depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power, and light. Despite abundant wind and hydroelectric power, proposals for statewide energy systems have been judged uneconomical due to low fuel prices, long distances, and low population. Additionally, the high cost of living and food transport costs pose significant challenges for residents, particularly in rural areas [Data: Claims (250, 251, 252, 320, 323, 327, 328)].\\n\\n## Religious Landscape\\n\\nThe religious landscape of Alaska is diverse, with Christianity being the dominant religion.

The state is known for its annual events such as the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which commemorates the historic 1925 serum run to Nome. Additionally, Alaska's history includes trade relations with Seattle and being supplied by Fort Ross, established by the Russian-American Company.

Notable political figures from Alaska include long-serving members of Congress such as Don Young and U.S. Senators like Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens [Data: Claims (253, 369, 370); Relationships (476, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627)].\\n\\n## Environmental and Natural Resource Management\\n\\nAlaska's vast wilderness and substantial natural resources, including significant coal deposits and high hydroelectric power potential, make it a critical area for environmental and natural resource management. The state faces unique transportation challenges due to its limited road connections, relying heavily on air and sea travel. Additionally, Alaska's economy benefits from its abundant seafood, with primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific [Data: Entities (63); Claims (320, 325, 326)].\\n\\n## Impact of Immigration\\n\\nImmigration has played a significant role in shaping Alaska's demographic landscape.

The American Community Survey and other demographic studies have provided detailed insights into the foreign-born population in Alaska, emphasizing the state's diverse and multicultural population [Data: Entities (860); Claims (300, 295)].\",\n",

The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California. The Colorado River forms the state\\'s southeast border with Arizona.\\nMost of California\\'s major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the Central Valley Project, providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the California State Water Project diverting water from Northern to Southern California. The state\\'s coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission.\\n\\n\\n=== Regions ===\\n\\nCalifornia is traditionally separated into Northern California and Southern California, divided by a straight border which runs across the state, separating the northern 48 counties from the southern 10 counties. Despite the persistence of the northern-southern divide, California is more precisely divided into many regions, multiple of which stretch across the northern-southern divide.\\n\\nMajor divisions\\nNorthern California\\nSouthern California\\nRegions\\n\\n\\n=== Cities and towns ===\\n\\nThe state has 483 incorporated cities and towns, of which 461 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms \"city\" and \"town\" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name)\".\\nSacramento became California\\'s first incorporated city on February 27, 1850. San Jose, San Diego, and Benicia tied for California\\'s second incorporated city, each receiving incorporation on March 27, 1850. Mountain House became the state\\'s most recent and 483rd incorporated municipality on July 1, 2024.\\nThe majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas: the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Riverside-San Bernardino Area, the San Diego metropolitan area, or the Sacramento metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Population ===\\n\\nPresently, close to one out of every nine United States residents lives in California. The United States Census Bureau reported that the population of California was 39.54 million on April 1, 2020, a 6.13% increase since the 2010 census. During that decade, the state\\'s population grew more slowly than the rest of the nation, resulting in the loss of one seat on the US House of Representatives, the first loss in its entire history. The estimated state population in 2023 was 38.94 million. For well over a century (1900–2020), California experienced steady population growth. Even while the rate of growth began to slow by the 1990s, some growth continued into the first two decades of the 21st century; California added an average of around 400,000 people per year to its population during the period 1940–2020. Then in 2020, the state began to experience population declines continuing every year, attributable mostly to moves out of state but also due to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, 818,000 California residents moved out of state with emigrants listing high cost of living, high taxes, and a difficult business environment as the motivation. The net loss of population in California between July 2020 and July 2023 was 433,000.\\n\\nThe Greater Los Angeles Area is the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States (U.S.), while Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the U.S. Conversely, San Francisco is the most densely-populated city in California and one of the most densely populated cities in the U.S.. Also, Los Angeles County has held the title of most populous U.S. county for decades, and it alone is more populous than 42 U.S. states. Including Los Angeles, four of the top 20 most populous cities in the U.S. are in California: Los Angeles (2nd), San Diego (8th), San Jose (10th), and San Francisco (17th). The center of population of California is located four miles west-southwest of the city of Shafter, Kern County.\\nAs of 2019, California ranked second among states by life expectancy, with a life expectancy of 80.9 years.\\nStarting in the year 2010, for the first time since the California Gold Rush, California-born residents made up the majority of the state\\'s population. Along with the rest of the United States, California\\'s immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s to early 2010s. Immigration from Latin American countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from Asia. In total for 2011, there were 277,304 immigrants. Fifty-seven percent came from Asian countries versus 22% from Latin American countries. Net immigration from Mexico, previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants, has dropped to zero / less than zero since more Mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating.\\nThe state\\'s population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years, due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers. The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest decreased from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 367,000 in 2011. Despite these recent trends, illegal aliens constituted an estimated 7.3 percent of the state\\'s population, the third highest percentage of any state in the country, totaling nearly 2.6 million.

According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes. Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004. This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production. In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue. In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue. The agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce.\\n\\n\\n=== Income ===\\n\\nPer capita GDP in 2021 was $85,546, ranking fourth in the nation. Per capita income varies widely by geographic region and profession. The Central Valley is the most impoverished, with migrant farm workers making less than minimum wage. According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, the San Joaquin Valley was characterized as one of the most economically depressed regions in the United States, on par with the region of Appalachia.\\nUsing the supplemental poverty measure, California has a poverty rate of 23.5%, the highest of any state in the country. However, using the official measure the poverty rate was only 13.3% as of 2017. Many coastal cities include some of the wealthiest per-capita areas in the United States. The high-technology sectors in Northern California, specifically Silicon Valley, in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, have emerged from the economic downturn caused by the dot-com bust.\\nIn 2019, there were 1,042,027 millionaire households in the state, more than any other state in the nation. In 2010, California residents were ranked first among the states with the best average credit score of 754.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== State finances ===\\n\\nState spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011. California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion. In January 2011, California's total debt was at least $265 billion. On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however, the state's debt remains at $132 billion.\\nWith the passage of Proposition 30 in 2012 and Proposition 55 in 2016, California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal income tax rate with ten tax brackets, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000 (though the top brackets are only temporary until Proposition 55 expires at the end of 2030). While Proposition 30 also enacted a minimum state sales tax of 7.5%, this sales tax increase was not extended by Proposition 55 and reverted to a previous minimum state sales tax rate of 7.25% in 2017. Local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes in addition to this minimum rate.\\nAll real property is taxable annually. Property tax increases are capped at 2% annually or the rate of inflation (whichever is lower), per Proposition 13.\\n\\n\\n== Infrastructure ==\\n\\n\\n=== Energy ===\\n\\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation facilities, however, moving water is the single largest energy use in the state. Also, due to high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States. Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46.\\nThe state's crude oil and natural gas deposits are located\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"ppen climate classification: Cfb), and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen Cfc) in the northern parts, with cool summers and relatively mild winters. On an annual basis, the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over 50 in (130 cm) of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150 in (380 cm). This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives 16 in (41 cm) of precipitation a year, with around 75 in (190 cm) of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc) due to its brief, cool summers.\\nThe climate of western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley (i.e., the region around Kotzebue Sound) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10 in (25 cm) of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 in (250 cm) of precipitation.\\nThe climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic and is a classic example of a continental subarctic climate, except in a few valleys where the climate approaches humid continental (Köppen: Dfb). Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. Summers are warm (albeit generally short) and may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the long and very cold winters, the temperature can fall below −60 °F (−51 °C). Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than 10 in (25 cm) a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.\\nThe highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is 100 °F (38 °C) in Fort Yukon (which is just 8 mi or 13 km inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915, making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States. The lowest official Alaska temperature is −80 °F (−62 °C) in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971, one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada).\\nThe climate in the extreme north of Alaska, north of the Brooks Range, is Arctic (Köppen: ET) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in Utqiaġvik is 34 °F (1 °C). Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than 10 in (25 cm) per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.\\n\\n\\n=== Flora and fauna ===\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nThe United States Census Bureau found in the 2020 United States census that the population of Alaska was 733,391 on April 1, 2020, a 3.3% increase since the 2010 United States census. According to the 2010 United States Census, the U.S. state of Alaska had a population of 710,231, a 13.3% increase from 626,932 at the 2000 U.S. census.\\nIn 2020, Alaska ranked as the 48th largest state by population, ahead of only Vermont and Wyoming. Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.46/km2), with the next state, Wyoming, at 5.8 inhabitants per square mile (2.2/km2). Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income). As of 2018 due to its population size, it is one of 14 U.S. states that still have only one telephone area code.\\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,320 homeless people in Alaska.\\n\\n\\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\\n\\nThe 2019 American Community Survey estimated 60.2% of the population was non-Hispanic white, 3.7% black or African American, 15.6% American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.5% Asian, 1.4% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 7.5% two or more races, and 7.3% Hispanic or Latin American of any race. At the survey estimates, 7.8% of the total population was foreign-born from 2015 to 2019. In 2015, 61.3% was non-Hispanic white, 3.4% black or African American, 13.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.2% Asian,\"},\n",

       "   'text': '\\'s de jure and de facto official language. According to the 2021 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, 56.08% (20,763,638) of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 43.92% spoke another language at home. 60.35% of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English \"well\" or \"very well\", with this figure varying significantly across the different linguistic groups. Like most U.S. states (32 out of 50), California law enshrines English as its official language, and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters in 1986. Various government agencies do, and are often required to, furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences.\\n\\nSpanish is the most commonly spoken language in California, behind English, spoken by 28.18% (10,434,308) of the population (in 2021). The Spanish language has been spoken in California since 1542 and is deeply intertwined with California\\'s cultural landscape and history. Spanish was the official administrative language of California through the Spanish and Mexican eras, until 1848. Following the U.S. Conquest of California and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the U.S. Government guaranteed the rights of Spanish-speaking Californians. The first Constitution of California was written in both languages at the Monterey Constitutional Convention of 1849 and protected the rights of Spanish speakers to use their language in government proceedings and mandating that all government documents be published in both English and Spanish.\\nDespite the initial recognition of Spanish by early American governments in California, the revised 1879 constitution stripped the rights of Spanish speakers and the official status of Spanish. The growth of the English-only movement by the mid-20th century led to the passage of 1986 California Proposition 63, which enshrined English as the only official language in California and ended Spanish language instruction in schools. 2016 California Proposition 58 reversed the prohibition on bilingual education, though there are still many barriers to the proliferation of Spanish bilingual education, including a shortage of teachers and lack of funding. The government of California has since made efforts to promote Spanish language access and bilingual education, as have private educational institutions in California. Many businesses in California promote the usage of Spanish by their employees, to better serve both California\\'s Hispanic population and the larger Spanish-speaking world.\\nCalifornia has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in six language families. A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages among California farmworkers. All of California\\'s indigenous languages are endangered, although there are now efforts toward language revitalization. California has the highest concentration nationwide of Chinese, Vietnamese and Punjabi speakers.\\nAs a result of the state\\'s increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken American English in California since the late 20th century. This variety, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from varieties of American English used in other regions of the United States.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nThe largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California\\'s population in 2014 were the Catholic Church with 28 percent, Evangelical Protestants with 20 percent, and Mainline Protestants with 10 percent. Together, all kinds of Protestants accounted for 32 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 27 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions is 1% Muslim, 2% Hindu and 2% Buddhist. This is a change from 2008, when the population identified their religion with the Catholic Church with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. In 2008, those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions in 2008 was 0.5% Muslim, 1% Hindu and 2% Buddhist. The American Jewish Year Book placed the total Jewish population of California at about 1,194,190 in 2006. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) the largest denominations by adherents in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 10,233,334; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 763,818; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 489,953.\\n\\nCalifornia has a large Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.\\nA Pew Research Center survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the states: 62 percent of Californians say they are \"absolutely certain\" of their belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is \"very important\", compared to 56 percent nationally.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nThe culture of California is a Western culture and has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences. As a border and coastal state, California culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia.\\nCalifornia has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise.
